## Rapid Prototyping
I need to structure this codebase in a way where i am able to quickly iterate over ideas.
  - It should be easy to add new shapes.
  - It should be easy to add new behavior.
  - It should be easy to toggle between different gameplay modes (real-time, non real-time).
  - It should be possible to keep track of score.
  - It should be possible to change these numbers on the fly.
  - It should be easy to draw the shapes outside of the grid.
  - It should be easy to change dimensions of the grid.
  - It should be easy to change the drop speed.
  - It should be easy to reset the game.
  - It should be easy to add things to the bag from the debug menu.

  - Scene transition to selection overlay
  - How to do scene transition?
